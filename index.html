					<b>Pitch, 09-11-2022:</b><br>
					Today we were introduced to the team for the first game project.
					Me and Emma held our game pitches and let the team vote on their favourite candidate in a Google
					Form we set up for the pitches.
					The game which was picked was Emma's "Call of Dinner". I look forward to working with these people,
					and the game idea is great so
					I have a good feeling about this.
				<p>
					<b>Day 1, 14-11-2022:</b><br>
					Pre-production of "Call of Dinner" began today. An art-, programmer-, and design-lead were appointed. 
					These will be responsible for communication between the teams. We also discussed workflow and scope. 
					Artists and Lead-designer had a discussion regarding artstyle and player perspective and scale.

					<b>Day 2-5, 15th to 18th-11-2022:</b> <br>
					I was abscent from the work as I was attending a funeral. 
					Still had contact via Discord answering queries and supplying feedback. Meanwhile, the team set up SourceControl, started producing
					basic models for props and enemies as well as improving the planning for the next coming weeks.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Day 6, 21-11-2022:</b><br>
				Started with a level block-out today. We assigned Loke as our Environment Artist to collaborate in the level. 
				Linus helped me set up GitFork and I managed to get into the project proper.
				At 2PM Emma held sprint review #1. Here on out I am going to hold the sprint reviews but seeing my absence last week we decided against it this time.

			<p>
				<b>Day 7, 22-11-2022:</b><br>
				Finished the level block-out today, started the communication between me and our Environment Artist.
				I was also tasked with creating a creative template for the future Call of Dinner Sprint Reviews, which I completed. 
				It now looks really clean while still in the style of the game. Also created a TEMP_Player to test the scale of the level and assets.
			</p>
			<p>
					<b>Day 8, 23-11-2022:</b><br>
				Emma was home sick today. I, also feeling under the weather managed to throw together a screenflow prototype with working buttons. 
				More and more props are being finished and I can more clearly see <i>how</i> the game will pan out. It is a pretty cool experience.
				Being the sole designer today I felt more responsbility and having to take more decisions which, to be honest; I appreciate.
			</p>
			<p>
					<b>Day 9, 24-11-2022:</b><br>
				The sickness has spread. I was bed-ridden most of today with a terrible man-cold.
				Looked over and updated the GDD thorougly with the new direction we're taking the game, no more multiplayer and lowered the scope until further notice.
				It's quite interesting to see how much the direction of a game can change within just the first week of production. Hopefully we can keep the current planned content
				but I do honestly believe we need to pickup the pace quite substantially in order to have a polished game by Christmas.
			</p>
			<p>
					<b>Day 10, 25-11-2022:</b><br>
				Still home recovering. Have been preparing the sprint review for next week. I get so restless being home during a project like this, 
				I want to be there and hands-on seeing what is going on and take part of the experience without the slow Discord communication.
			</p>
			<p>
					<b>Day 11, 28-11-2022:</b><br>
				Back to Playgroundsquad. Held a meeting where we planned out the workflow for the week among the entire team. 
				I fixed up the sprint review for the previous week and presented our current planning. 
				While my approach to keep it short and concise was not upheld by the other groups I still appreciate this way of presenting more than having 
				elaborate info-dumps of melatonin production. The presentation went fine, but I was reminded of the Milestone due at the end of the week. Stress has re-entered my body!

				<b>Day 12, 29-11-2022:</b><br>
			Decided to play artist today. I taught myself how to do VFX and managed to create a styalized smoke pillar for the cooking of food. 
			After stressing the programmers a little we managed to get the player controller to work. 
			Other than that today has been mostly managing and checking on the other disciplines. Tomorrow's goal is to have the prototype Milestone Build ready for playtesting.

			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Day 13,30-11-2022:</b><br>
			Worked on more VFX today. Making muzzle fire is much more tedious than a pillar of smoke so 
			I had to try to learn from tutorials which were not compatible with the engine version I am using making me waste a couple of hours of work.
			It's very frustrating to have little to no progress during a day like this. But I can't let that stress affect me, tomorrow we implement all the systems,
			assets, win & lose condition. I would be lying if I didn't say that I was worried.
		</p>
			<p>
				<b>Day 14, 01-12-2022:</b><br>
			Today we spent all day implementing the systems made by the programmers, adding assets made by the artists and swearing loudly and often at Source Control, 
			with merge errors. Check out errors, lost progress and countless exclamations of "But it works on my screen!". At the time of writing today's entry the time is 21:15 
			and we will be working for an hour or two more. Hopefully we have enough of a prototype for tomorrow's milestone presentation but I am not entirely sure seeing how 
			currently we have a good looking scene with no mechanics other than running and spawning in enemies with no inherent purpose. I feel like this might be caused by us 
			being handicapped by the assignment, but also that I have not been managing the work as much as I maybe should've? I am quite frankly exhausted right now and I realize 
			why game developers burn out on a frequent basis. Not that I am there yet, whenever we have a breakthrough I get back most of my motivation until Unreal has its 7th 
			consecutive crash.
			</p>
<p>
	<b>Day 15, 02-12-2022:</b><br>
	| Milestone day | <br>
			Had our first (and only) milestone for this project. Got to know ~1h before we were-a go that there was supposed to be some sort of visual presentation 
			outside of the first build. This lack of communication, combined with me being the sole Designer on-site AND the long night yesterday had be very stressed and anxious. 
			Thankfully I have great friends and Supervisor Martin had a calming talk with me which also helped get me down to earth. The presentation went very well with jokes and 
			banter scattered in; and despite building the game (and having Albin fix the fatal errors 5 minutes beforehand) we managed to show off a stable build of the game! 
			My anxiety is much better now afterwards, we have internally summarised what we have left to do on the game and I think we will reach a pretty good state by the 
			end of all of this.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Day 16, 05-12-2022:</b><br>
			Back at it for another Monday. I have been working with VFX, got muzzle flash to work and got a basic splatter for when my enemies are shot. We set a deadline for 
			feature-programming to be done on Friday. Might be able to keep that up. Started setting up the player HUD which will probably be my work for the week.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Day 17, 06-12-2022:</b><br>
			Spent the day implementing the UI from Kade, making the healthbar functional and getting the AmmoCount on the screen. I also had a discussion with another group about some
			ineherent design problems their game has and how they should not be adding new features to solve them, but rather look and change what they already have. Programmers have started
			implementing final (but non-optimized) versions of systems onto the Main Level in UE5. We will soon have a very playable prototype!
</p>
<p>
	<b>Day 18, 07-12-2022:</b><br>
			Healthbar and AmmoCount are fully implemented, working as intended and looking real good! Got to see the tomato animations in action as well, they are super cute 
			and I can really feel the project coming together! Next up while waiting for more UI assets I am going to be working on implementing the VFX I made last week so  that 
			they work in tandem with all the other functionality.

	<b>Day 19 & 20, 08/09-12-2022:</b><br>
		Was home with a migraine, managed to find some suitable music for the main screen and in-game. Not very productive otherwise.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Day 21, 12-12-2022:</b><br>
		Sprint 4 today! We showed off the interactable system in the latest build. This week we will be working really hard to implement all of the systems and make sure 
		that they work in tandem with each other and that they are fun to interact with. I need to rework the muzzleflash VFX to make sure that it really feels nice. 
		For this week; Player feedback is all the rage, I have a feeling it might not be as good as envisioned; but I will definitely be proud over this!
</p>
<p>
	<b>Day 22, 13-12-2022:</b><br>
	Good progress today, the gameplay loop is being implemented at lightning speed and I have been working hard on tomato splatter VFX while Loke took over the muzzle flash.
	Tomorrow at 5 is deadline for Playtest Build 1, this is going to be hectic but I belive we can do it if we work a little bit overtime. All the assets are finally coming together
	and despite be going crazy over variables not being Blueprint accessible the work is inspiring! This is turning out great!
</p>
<p>
	<b>Day 23, 14-12-2022:</b><br>
	Started implementing sounds, animations & systems onto the main assets today. Got PlayerShooting, PlayerMelee & PlayerPickup to work with good looping and blending, in my opinion.
	The game immediately feels more satisfying to play with even this little feedback and I really understand why there has been emphasis on said feedback.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Day 24, 15-12-2022:</b><br>
	Continued implementing sounds and animations got PlayerReload to work in tandem with a reload sound with scuffed designer solutions in Blueprints!
	We had to cancel our planned playtest last minute as a gamebreaking bug emerged which we didn't know how to fix. Safe to say that after fiddling with it for about 2h we took
	an "early" day off for mental recovery.

					<b>Pitch, 09-11-2022:</b>
					Today we were introduced to the team for the first game project.
					Me and Emma held our game pitches and let the team vote on their favourite candidate in a Google
					Form we set up for the pitches.
					The game which was picked was Emma's "Call of Dinner". I look forward to working with these people,
					and the game idea is great so
					I have a good feeling about this.
				<p>
					<b>Day 1, 14-11-2022:</b>
					Pre-production of "Call of Dinner" began today. An art-, programmer-, and design-lead were appointed. 
					These will be responsible for communication between the teams. We also discussed workflow and scope. 
					Artists and Lead-designer had a discussion regarding artstyle and player perspective and scale.

					<b>Day 2-5, 15th to 18th-11-2022:</b> 
					I was abscent from the work as I was attending a funeral. 
					Still had contact via Discord answering queries and supplying feedback. Meanwhile, the team set up SourceControl, started producing
					basic models for props and enemies as well as improving the planning for the next coming weeks.
				</p>
				<p>
				<b>Day 6, 21-11-2022:</b>
				Started with a level block-out today. We assigned Loke as our Environment Artist to collaborate in the level. 
				Linus helped me set up GitFork and I managed to get into the project proper.
				At 2PM Emma held sprint review #1. Here on out I am going to hold the sprint reviews but seeing my absence last week we decided against it this time.

				<b>Day 7, 22-11-2022:</b>
				Finished the level block-out today, started the communication between me and our Environment Artist.
				I was also tasked with creating a creative template for the future Call of Dinner Sprint Reviews, which I completed. 
				It now looks really clean while still in the style of the game. Also created a TEMP_Player to test the scale of the level and assets.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Day 8, 23-11-2022:</b>
				Emma was home sick today. I, also feeling under the weather managed to throw together a screenflow prototype with working buttons. 
				More and more props are being finished and I can more clearly see <i>how</i> the game will pan out. It is a pretty cool experience.
				Being the sole designer today I felt more responsbility and having to take more decisions which, to be honest; I appreciate.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Day 9, 24-11-2022:</b>
				The sickness has spread. I was bed-ridden most of today with a terrible man-cold.
				Looked over and updated the GDD thorougly with the new direction we're taking the game, no more multiplayer and lowered the scope until further notice.
				It's quite interesting to see how much the direction of a game can change within just the first week of production. Hopefully we can keep the current planned content
				but I do honestly believe we need to pickup the pace quite substantially in order to have a polished game by Christmas.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Day 10, 25-11-2022:</b>
				Still home recovering. Have been preparing the sprint review for next week. I get so restless being home during a project like this, 
				I want to be there and hands-on seeing what is going on and take part of the experience without the slow Discord communication.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Day 11, 28-11-2022:</b>
				Back to Playgroundsquad. Held a meeting where we planned out the workflow for the week among the entire team. 
				I fixed up the sprint review for the previous week and presented our current planning. 
				While my approach to keep it short and concise was not upheld by the other groups I still appreciate this way of presenting more than having 
				elaborate info-dumps of melatonin production. The presentation went fine, but I was reminded of the Milestone due at the end of the week. Stress has re-entered my body!

				<b>Day 12, 29-11-2022:</b>
			Decided to play artist today. I taught myself how to do VFX and managed to create a styalized smoke pillar for the cooking of food. 
			After stressing the programmers a little we managed to get the player controller to work. 
			Other than that today has been mostly managing and checking on the other disciplines. Tomorrow's goal is to have the prototype Milestone Build ready for playtesting.

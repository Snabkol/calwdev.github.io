					<b>Pitch, 09-11-2022:</b><br>
					Today we were introduced to the team for the first game project.
					Me and Emma held our game pitches and let the team vote on their favourite candidate in a Google
					Form we set up for the pitches.
					The game which was picked was Emma's "Call of Dinner". I look forward to working with these people,
					and the game idea is great so
					I have a good feeling about this.
				<p>
					<b>Day 1, 14-11-2022:</b><br>
					Pre-production of "Call of Dinner" began today. An art-, programmer-, and design-lead were
					appointed.
					These will be responsible for communication between the teams. We also discussed workflow and scope.
					Artists and Lead-designer had a discussion regarding artstyle and player perspective and scale.

				<b>Day 2-5, 15th to 18th-11-2022:</b> <br>
				I was abscent from the work as I was attending a funeral.
				Still had contact via Discord answering queries and supplying feedback. Meanwhile, the team set up
				SourceControl, started producing
				basic models for props and enemies as well as improving the planning for the next coming weeks.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Day 6, 21-11-2022:</b><br>
					Started with a level block-out today. We assigned Loke as our Environment Artist to collaborate in
					the level.
					Linus helped me set up GitFork and I managed to get into the project proper.
					At 2PM Emma held sprint review #1. Here on out I am going to hold the sprint reviews but seeing my
					absence last week we decided against it this time.

					</div>
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Day 7, 22-11-2022:</b><br>
						Finished the level block-out today, started the communication between me and our Environment
						Artist.
						I was also tasked with creating a creative template for the future Call of Dinner Sprint
						Reviews, which I completed.
						It now looks really clean while still in the style of the game. Also created a TEMP_Player to
						test the scale of the level and assets.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Day 8, 23-11-2022:</b><br>
						Emma was home sick today. I, also feeling under the weather managed to throw together a
						screenflow prototype with working buttons.
						More and more props are being finished and I can more clearly see <i>how</i> the game will pan
						out. It is a pretty cool experience.
						Being the sole designer today I felt more responsbility and having to take more decisions which,
						to be honest; I appreciate.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Day 9, 24-11-2022:</b><br>
						The sickness has spread. I was bed-ridden most of today with a terrible man-cold.
						Looked over and updated the GDD thorougly with the new direction we're taking the game, no more
						multiplayer and lowered the scope until further notice.
						It's quite interesting to see how much the direction of a game can change within just the first
						week of production. Hopefully we can keep the current planned content
						but I do honestly believe we need to pickup the pace quite substantially in order to have a
						polished game by Christmas.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Day 10, 25-11-2022:</b><br>
						Still home recovering. Have been preparing the sprint review for next week. I get so restless
						being home during a project like this,
						I want to be there and hands-on seeing what is going on and take part of the experience without
						the slow Discord communication.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Day 11, 28-11-2022:</b><br>
						Back to Playgroundsquad. Held a meeting where we planned out the workflow for the week among the
						entire team.
						I fixed up the sprint review for the previous week and presented our current planning.
						While my approach to keep it short and concise was not upheld by the other groups I still
						appreciate this way of presenting more than having
						elaborate info-dumps of melatonin production. The presentation went fine, but I was reminded of
						the Milestone due at the end of the week. Stress has re-entered my body!

						<p>
							<b>Day 12, 29-11-2022:</b><br>
							Decided to play artist today. I taught myself how to do VFX and managed to create a
							styalized smoke pillar for the cooking of food.
							After stressing the programmers a little we managed to get the player controller to work.
							Other than that today has been mostly managing and checking on the other disciplines.
							Tomorrow's goal is to have the prototype Milestone Build ready for playtesting.
						<div class="row">
							<div class="col-4 col-6-medium col-12-small">
								<a class="image fit"><img src="images\Smoke.gif"></a>
							</div>
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Day 13,30-11-2022:</b><br>
								Worked on more VFX today. Making muzzle fire is much more tedious than a pillar of smoke
								so
								I had to try to learn from tutorials which were not compatible with the engine version I
								am using making me waste a couple of hours of work.
								It's very frustrating to have little to no progress during a day like this. But I can't
								let that stress affect me, tomorrow we implement all the systems,
								assets, win & lose condition. I would be lying if I didn't say that I was worried.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Day 14, 01-12-2022:</b><br>
								Today we spent all day implementing the systems made by the programmers, adding assets
								made by the artists and swearing loudly and often at Source Control,
								with merge errors. Check out errors, lost progress and countless exclamations of "But it
								works on my screen!". At the time of writing today's entry the time is 21:15
								and we will be working for an hour or two more. Hopefully we have enough of a prototype
								for tomorrow's milestone presentation but I am not entirely sure seeing how
								currently we have a good looking scene with no mechanics other than running and spawning
								in enemies with no inherent purpose. I feel like this might be caused by us
								being handicapped by the assignment, but also that I have not been managing the work as
								much as I maybe should've? I am quite frankly exhausted right now and I realize
								why game developers burn out on a frequent basis. Not that I am there yet, whenever we
								have a breakthrough I get back most of my motivation until Unreal has its 7th
								consecutive crash.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Day 15, 02-12-2022:</b><br>
								| Milestone day | <br>
								Had our first (and only) milestone for this project. Got to know ~1h before we were-a go
								that there was supposed to be some sort of visual presentation
								outside of the first build. This lack of communication, combined with me being the sole
								Designer on-site AND the long night yesterday had be very stressed and anxious.
								Thankfully I have great friends and Supervisor Martin had a calming talk with me which
								also helped get me down to earth. The presentation went very well with jokes and
								banter scattered in; and despite building the game (and having Albin fix the fatal
								errors 5 minutes beforehand) we managed to show off a stable build of the game!
								My anxiety is much better now afterwards, we have internally summarised what we have
								left to do on the game and I think we will reach a pretty good state by the
								end of all of this.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Day 16, 05-12-2022:</b><br>
								Back at it for another Monday. I have been working with VFX, got muzzle flash to work
								and got a basic splatter for when my enemies are shot. We set a deadline for
								feature-programming to be done on Friday. Might be able to keep that up. Started setting
								up the player HUD which will probably be my work for the week.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Day 17, 06-12-2022:</b><br>
								Spent the day implementing the UI from Kade, making the healthbar functional and getting
								the AmmoCount on the screen. I also had a discussion with another group about some
								ineherent design problems their game has and how they should not be adding new features
								to solve them, but rather look and change what they already have. Programmers have
								started
								implementing final (but non-optimized) versions of systems onto the Main Level in UE5.
								We will soon have a very playable prototype!
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Day 18, 07-12-2022:</b><br>
								Healthbar and AmmoCount are fully implemented, working as intended and looking real
								good! Got to see the tomato animations in action as well, they are super cute
								and I can really feel the project coming together! Next up while waiting for more UI
								assets I am going to be working on implementing the VFX I made last week so that
								they work in tandem with all the other functionality.

								<p>
									<b>Day 19 & 20, 08/09-12-2022:</b><br>
									Was home with a migraine, managed to find some suitable music for the main screen
									and in-game. Not very productive otherwise.
								</p>
								<p>
									<b>Day 21, 12-12-2022:</b><br>
									Sprint 4 today! We showed off the interactable system in the latest build. This week
									we will be working really hard to implement all of the systems and make sure
									that they work in tandem with each other and that they are fun to interact with. I
									need to rework the muzzleflash VFX to make sure that it really feels nice.
									For this week; Player feedback is all the rage, I have a feeling it might not be as
									good as envisioned; but I will definitely be proud over this!
								</p>
								<p>
									<b>Day 22, 13-12-2022:</b><br>
									Good progress today, the gameplay loop is being implemented at lightning speed and I
									have been working hard on tomato splatter VFX while Loke took over the muzzle flash.
									Tomorrow at 5 is deadline for Playtest Build 1, this is going to be hectic but I
									belive we can do it if we work a little bit overtime. All the assets are finally
									coming together
									and despite be going crazy over variables not being Blueprint accessible the work is
									inspiring! This is turning out great!
								</p>
								<p>
									<b>Day 23, 14-12-2022:</b><br>
									Started implementing sounds, animations & systems onto the main assets today. Got
									PlayerShooting, PlayerMelee & PlayerPickup to work with good looping and blending,
									in my opinion.
									The game immediately feels more satisfying to play with even this little feedback
									and I really understand why there has been emphasis on said feedback.
								</p>
								<p>
									<b>Day 24, 15-12-2022:</b><br>
									Continued implementing sounds and animations got PlayerReload to work in tandem with
									a reload sound with scuffed designer solutions in Blueprints!
								</p>
								<p>
									<b>Day 25, 16-12-2022:</b><br>
									We had to cancel our planned playtest last minute as a gamebreaking bug emerged
									which we didn't know how to fix. Safe to say that after fiddling with it for about
									2h we took
									an "early" day off for mental recovery.
								</p>
								<p>
									<b>Day 27, 19-12-2022:</b><br>
									Kept implementing sounds and fiddling with numbers and prepared to hold the final
									sprint review! After fixing the bug from last Friday we got a build going with
									almost all
									feedback and planned features added. The game is playable and the build we showed
									off during the sprint has been sent out to friends and family as a playtest build so
									we can get
									some last minute feedback on Call of Dinner!<br>
									The PT build can be found here:<a

										Build</a><br>
									Playtest Feedback form:<a href="https://forms.gle/dnkzFxkwqtRxYs4h7"> Form</a>
								</p>
								<p>
									<b>Day 28, 20-12-2022:</b><br>
									Final touches on UI animations and variables. Today only me and programmer Albin
									were present on the technical side of the game. So we had a lot of work to do
									fiddling with all
									the smaller things, making sure nothing had broken down during our persistent
									development of the game. All sounds should now be implemented and work "properly",
									we have done all
									the sounds as 2D and it creates some issued but that it how it is right now. It's
									looking bright for the GOLD milestone of the game!
								</p>
								<p>
									<b>Day 29, 21-12-2022:</b><br>
									Final touches on EVERYTHING today. Finished the UI, finished the variables. Made a
									Gold Presentation and added a ton of props in the main level. The game is built and
									ready for
									"shipping" tomorrow. I don't know if I am ready for presenting and letting the game
									go however. Had some last minute rendering issued with the tomatoes' weapons, but we
									did a
									butchered fix and now it works!

										<b>Day 30, 22-12-2022</b><br>
										| GOLD MILESTONE |<br>
										Held the game Gold presentation. It went well and everyone was happy to be done
										with the game, and to see the other games which were on display.
										Such a great ending to a great project. Thanks to the Stewdio team for being
										awesome and communicative, and thanks to Playgroundsquad to enable us to create
										art.

				<p>
					<b>Day 1, 20-03-2023:</b><br>
					Pre-production started yesterday. I pitched the game twice, once for the main team and once for the
					sound crew. We all set up Milanote, Pinterest,
					started writing on the GDD and so much more. This week of pre-prod is going to be interesting but
					rewarding I think. The team seems excited to get started.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Day 2, 21-03-2023:</b><br>
					Started up an Asset List today. The COO of Tension held a Kick-off for the group where we got to
					discuss goals, plans & expectations.
					Felt like a neccessary evil but incredibly boring and personally unproductive. Afterwards Designers
					had a little meeting which started off as a
					clarification of roles and ended up being a solidification of roles. I am now officially Project
					Manager, Lead Designer & Lines of Communications officer
					(or whatever that title would be called) It is going to be an interesting project this. I think
					we'll get some great work in these 9 weeks.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Day 3, 22-03-2023:</b><br>
					Started the day with a meeting with the sound engineers, getting them up to speed; setting roles and
					expectations! The rest of the day went into answering questions
					regarding characters and level layout. Streamlining the Milanote & newly set up Miro moodboard. For
					tomorrow we are just going sit down and spew out a million modules.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Day 4, 23-03-2023:</b><br>
					Today has been spent coming up with new modules; figuring out how menus might (or might not work),
					Downloaded the engine, set up Git and did my first pull/push of
					the project. Good vibes.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Day 5, 24-03-2023:</b><br>
					Today was rather productive. Everyone set-up Git, got into the engine and we started tweaking around
					with the VR-Template from Unreal 5. I threw together a simple
					top-down 2D Level Layout for the artists to get some scale. Also continued to churn out modules,
					decided on an inital control-scheme & finished up the presentation
					for Sprint #1.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Day 6, 27-03-2023:</b><br>
					Finished the presentation for Sprint #1. It went pretty good! Afterwards we sat down with the lead
					programmer & artist and cobbled together a roadmap for the rest of
					the project. It was documented into a Word document and I am currently in the process of making it
					into a pretty presentation so that the team can get better overview
					of the planning and timeline. On Wednesday we are going to sit down with the Sound Engineers to
					build their piece of the roadmap as well as set the workflow for sound
					effects; voicelines & music production.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Day 7, 28-03-2023:</b><br>
					Made a Roadmap for the project. This is going to be a living roadmap which will adapt slightly and
					it will be updated with all the sound tomorrow when we meet the
					sound students. The rest of the day was spent testing out scale with our props. We had some issues
					trying to get it right for me (short) and Anton (tall). So we found
					a middle ground before we found out that there are actually settings in the hardware itself to
					adjust floor height. Me and & George also sat down and determined the
					importance for some of the modules so we know what we need for the Beta Vs. Gold should be good to
					go!
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Day 8, 29-03-2023:</b><br>
					Updated the roadmap to finally include Sound Engineers! We had to be rather lenient with their
					deadlines as they also have other school work going on at the same time.
					It sucks of course but it is what it is. We will try to make-do with the studio at the premise and
					some elbow grease to get all of the different effects and voices
					ready in time. Also sat down and really got some concrete sounds, voice lines & music sent into the
					pipeline so they can start being produced! We finally got a
					studio-name as well: The studio is now known as <i>Trolley Problem Productions</i> a logo
					competition is in the works and I have submitted my own attempt which I am
					pretty happy about. I also begun blocking out the main UI elements so that we can get some artistic
					and programming input on it. I am shuddering over the lack of
					artistic skill but it hopefully gets the point across.

					<p>
						<b>Day 9, 30-03-2023:</b><br>
						Today I was rather stumped on what to do; but then it dawned on me: We have a sound studio in
						the basement. Spent most of the day doing spoof recordings,
						learning how to use FL Studio and producing some simple voice lines. Together with some team
						members (and outsourcing) I cooked up 9 sets of voicelines with some
						takes in between. I had some issues with the software such as the audio being recorded in mono-
						some recordings not going longer than 2 seconds and just general
						tweaking of the audio in FL being unfamilliar to me. I will continue to record lines throughout
						the project as we are in need of so many.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Day 10, 31-03-2023:</b><br>
						Felt ill so I stayed home. Prepared a Sprint Presentation and had worked on some personal
						prototypes. Not very productive on Alien Intern for my part.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Day 11, 03-04-2023:</b><br>
						In the morning I finalised the Sprint Presentation for today with animations and showcasing some
						of the work we have been doing during the week. It went really well
						and I am incredibly happy with the team's efforts through the last week we got some feedback
						about the layout, specifically regarding the roadmap and layout of the
						sprint. Instead of showing our deadlines in the roadmap we are supposed to show instead what we
						have been working on and what we're working on..so we'll be making a
						different kind of roadmap to show, not deadlines, but ..current lines?
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Day 12, 04-04-2023:</b><br>
						Made an alpha presentation for tomorrow's escapades. It presents what the game is about & what
						we have for the showcase! Also planned out how we are going to present
						the Alpha in a fun and interactive way. We currently have everything but object grabbing
						implemented within the game which is quite reassuring. We might not have it by
						tomorrow but then so be it. I am in a weird mental state today so I feel like I haven't really
						done much, hope it passes until tomorrow.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Day 13, 05-04-2023:</b><br>
						After a couple of tedious hours with buggy physics, teleporting not working, UI elements being
						added last minute, new art being added last minute we got a working
						build very last second which was an epic win for the team! Me & George presented the Alpha
						gameplay with the Home Environment to show off the synthesizer & physics
						objects. Then we showed off the workplace with a couple of modules. Finally we had a little
						Alpha Museum in which we had assets and concept art which was not visible
						inside the other two rooms just to show off what everyone has been doing. It was quite a
						successful presentation and I am rather happy about it. Now however, I am
						completely drained socially and need a break. Can't wait for easter.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Day 14, 11-04-2023:</b><br>
						Back from birthday and easter. Back on track. Today we have sat down and made lists of
						priorities for animations and props. We took care of our little shadow today;
						he playtested the game and started to look a bit behind-the-scenes on how game development may
						look like. Afterwhich I sat in engine and made Module LEGO with some
						meshes that the artists had been cooking up. We are aiming to have a "Beta-lite" on Friday with
						a full playable day and most systems somewhat in place!
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Day 15, 12-04-2023:</b><br>
						Today has been an exhausting day. I started working on the UI implementation but as I had gotten
						into the workflow I was interrupted as there had been a
						misunderstanding in how we were dealing with UI, so I scrapped what I had done and worked
						together with our responsible UI programmer and made sure that they had
						all the information and layouts ready so that they could make the functionality purely in C++ to
						further optimize our game. After that adaptive maneuvre I also had
						to deal with a dispute between our level Designer and another designer where they could not
						agree on which layout would be best for the game. I had them try it out
						in-engine instead of verbally trying to explain which went nowhere. George also taught me about
						physics constraints and a good workflow for me to be able to further
						aid in implementation of the modules.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Day 16, 13-04-2023:</b><br>
						Today I have been working mostly with modules, trying to get it to work but with the current way
						we have our buttons I have been struggling a little bit. But slowly
						I learned how to make it work nicely! I was working on a gameloop flowchart.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Day 17, 24-04-2023:</b><br>
						Back at the game project after losing a week to Companies having talks last week. That in itself
						was very insightful but now we need to replan and reassess the backlog.
						The morning was spent creating a physical Post-It Backlog. It looks very nice and it is going to
						be satisfying to move the notes onec the status changes on whatever is
						being worked on. I would lie if I didn't say that I had been feelign very stressed and anxious
						about the whole thing but it hopefully gets better throughout the week.
						I spent a lot of time today preparing for the sprint, and also to set-up our sound studio which
						now is located just next to our normal station, as in across the room.
						It is pretty terrible but we'll make-do. I also started to further implement the UI visuals to
						make it pop.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Day 18, 25-04-2023:</b><br>
						I recorded a multitude of voicelines today, everything from the Alien Assistant to pesky
						neighbours & an awesome political campaign. This is going to be really
						interesting to work with and edit. Having the sound studio in the same room as we work in
						creates a funny little issue with background noise but there's nothing we
						can do barring noisegates. I have cleaned up the audio to the best of my ability. As a funny
						little sidequest I asked everyone in our group and the other groups in
						the building to come up with random voicelines so we can have a larger variety in sounds and
						content! Day was cut short by mandatory(tm) Open-House visitation at
						Tenstar.

						<b>Day 19, 26-04-2023:</b><br>
						Recorded the final voicelines for the BETA today. Two variations of the important boss call &
						cut and edited the voicelines from yesterday. I also sorted out all the
						UI menus so that they have a good layout in-engine & Markus can start making my shitty designer
						art into a pretty masterpiece. I feel a lot of less stress today
						compared to Monday where I nearly fainted.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Day 20, 27-04-2023:</b><br>
						Such a clusterF' of implementing sounds with bouncing around checked out files in Unreal, an
						audio system that doesn't really work and different opinions have
						culminated today to become one of the most productive days yet. Tomorrow is BETA and we feel
						rather ready. It is just a BETA presentation remaining. I am anxious as
						hell but, it just has to work. Final changes tomorrow and the deadline is 13.30. Please work.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Day 21, 28-04-2023:</b><br>
						BETA! Another stressful presentation day with a million things needing to be implemented &
						planning gone awry by silly bugs. Despite having a backup build we decided
						to stress it and make an updated build same day. We added updated menus, modules, gameflow and
						added som QOL changes to really make the game pop for the presentation.
						The presentation itself ended up being a mixed bag. I was nervous in front of our esteemed
						guests and forgot some important information regarding the game but we
						managed to salvage it with some gameplay even though that was also lacking in some departments.
						I am going on break now for Valborg. I am going to need it.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Day 22, 02-05-2023:</b><br>
						Back from a long refreshing weekend. Today has mostly been spent adding everything that is
						needed for the finished game onto our tasklist and getting the tasks ready
						for delegation. We had a visit from Stunlock Studios which interrupted our workflow but it was
						so insightful that I was not really bothered by it. I have been designing
						a credits menu to be able to clearly give credit where credit is due to our lovely developers.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Day 23, 03-05-2023:</b><br>
						I have been working on reformatting and updating the GDD so it is completely up to date. I also
						acted as major game tester speed testing multiple modules and their
						variables to make sure that they feel good!
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Day 26, 08-05-2023:</b><br>
						Prepared Sprint today. We were shunned a lot for a lack of feedback in our game so me and Hari
						have decided to do some planned crunch Wednesday & Thursday to improve
						the feedback significantly. Today has been spent preparing a sprint presentation and trying to
						fix a weird issue with physics constraints where they sometimes unparent the component they try
						to attach. Trying to find fix!

					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Day 27, 09-05-2023:</b><br>
						Today I altered the Wrist Menu and made most of the sounds into cues. It went fairly well. I
						also started on a system to change the light in the VR environment when
						the stockmarket is crashing. I also stayed late to re-record all the voice lines of the Virtual
						Assistant as they were quite outdated due to iterations of modules.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Day 28, 10-05-2023:</b><br>
						Managed to fix an issue with the Distance-Grab-Tractorbeam-VFX where it would not kill itself
						after not being called. Also worked on updating the virtual scrum board
						as it was in quite the state of disrepair. Did some more voicelines that I did not have time for
						yesterday. We had an issue where our modules would start as their
						tutorial voicelines were playing. But as we are using a form of timeline I suggested that we
						could pause it and use the delegate of the audio finish unpause the
						timeline and that was apparently a revolutionary thought. I felt pretty proud coming up with
						that solution.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Day 29, 11-05-2023:</b><br>
						Added the new reworked lines to engine. Today I was fiddling with haptic feedback curves, I
						don't fully understand how they work but the amplitude & frequency
						settings should become apparent as I play around with them more and more. I also rotated some of
						our fake lights to make the shadowcapture work properly. I also
						added some textures for the Gymbro table to accomodate for it using a mouth to speak now!
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Day 30, 12-05-2023:</b><br>
						Today I started what I refer to as the <i>Great Sound Renaissance</i>, where I take inventory on
						all our sound effects & voicelines and make sure that they have the
						correct settings. The settings that need to be applied are Sound Classes, Attenuation Settings,
						Envelope Voice Chains & Virtulization Mode. This is a pretty large
						undertaking but should not take me too long thanks to unreal's batch editing of soundwaves. I
						also pushed up some voicelines that I had forgotten to..whoops!
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Day 31, 15-05-2023:</b><br>
						The <i>Great Sound Renaissance</i> has been concluded. All sounds were updated with their
						appropriate settings. We noticed an issue with our mouths changing texture
						as they're talking. We changed it so that the textures no longer uses texture streaming and that
						fixed the issue; the characters no longer go blurry when changing
						texture. More bugs have been fixed on my part, I made it so that the alarm resets when you reset
						the day, and I also added another icon above the modules to indicate
						that they are about to start, and one that indicates that they are started. This should be
						enough feedback for the players, with two sets of icons, a voiceline and
						colour feedback on interactables. I hope. We also threw in confetti & a text for when you win
						the day or if you would lose the day!
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Day 32, 16-05-2023:</b><br>
						I updated the modules with module arrows and clocks having them activate proper and having them
						located at a nice location in relation to their respective modules! I
						also set up so that we have a new song in the main menu and the whole team rejoiced after
						listening to the same theme for 8 weeks! It was quite uplifting actually.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Day 33, 17-05-2023:</b><br>
						The final day before GOLD. I spent the day triple checking all the sounds and playtesting a
						whole lot. I also helped Hari record for the trailer. This is going good, we can make this.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Day 34, 19-05-2023:</b><br>
						| GOLD PRESENTATION |<br>
						Today we held our presentations for the representatives at SONY, the school and anyone else who
						had the pleasure of being around. It went really well for all the
						groups, so much hard work has gone into these projects its inspiring. Some of the feedback we
						got from the presentation was that we should lean more into the
						bite-sized gameplay our game offers as it is good for the VR format. We held some playtests just
						after and I am so proud over the group's effort and the product we
						made during the 9 weeks.

					<h2>Game Project 3 - <i>Trouble in Loomie Land</i></h2>
					<h3>Developed by: Smultronbarna'</h3><br>
				</header>
				<p>

					<b>Day 1, 18-09-2023:</b><br>
					Pre-production started yesterday. I pitched the game to the supervisors. We all set up Trello,
					Milanote and
					started writing on the GDD. We also chose our studio name: Smultronbarna'

				</p>
				<p>

					<b>Day 2, 19-09-2023:</b><br>
					Started the day with a meeting together with Linus to sit and design the gameplay of the player and
					the world.
					We decided to try to make a simplistic platformer inspired by hat in time and Super Mario 64. I sat
					down in Unreal and
					started to prototype some of the mechanics to get a grasp of how it could look like. I also started
					on a UI prototype but was quickly shut down by
					other ideas which I thought were much better.

				</p>
				<p>

					<b>Day 3, 20-09-2023:</b><br>
					I spent most of the morning sending internship applications. The rest of the day I spent setting up
					the very basics of our avatar together with programmers.
					We also had a checkup on the art department to see if our planning seemed in-scope for them which
					they greenlit.

				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Day 4, 21-09-2023:</b><br>
					Spent the day representing Playgroundsquad at a convention. No work was done.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Day 5, 22-09-2023:</b><br>
					Was sick. No work was done.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Day 6, 25-09-2023:</b><br>
					I spent the day applying for internships. Not much work on the game was done.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Day 7, 26-09-2023:</b><br>
					We had a meeting regarding the design team and the group dynamic which has been rather lacking. It
					feels better after this meeting.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Day 8, 27-09-2023:</b><br>
					Today I spent prototyping player pickups. Chosing a Power-Up and some basic UI elements for it.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Day 9, 28-09-2023:</b><br>
					Spent all day making the logic for throwing a fishing rod and giving the player feedback on where it
					will hit and changing the camera position. We went through some iterations but ended up on a subtle
					blue gradient of glowing balls to indicate the projectile path of the fishing bobber.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Day 12, 29-09-2023:</b><br>
					Today I implemented the radial menu for selecting power ups. The fishing rod can also pull the other
					player towards themselves.
					I also cleaned up some of my spaghetti so that it can be reusable in more contexts (i.e the fishing
					rod can hit multiple types of actors).
					<a href="images/LL_FishingRodPrototype1.mkv">Fishing Rod demonstration</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Day 13, 02-10-2023:</b><br>
					Was struggling with having the HUD update for both players when a collectible was picked up. Gonna
					keep looking at it tomorrow, for now I am polishing the fishing prediction path and made it even
					clearer where the player will hit.
					<a href="images/LL_FishingRodPrototype2.mkv"></a>

				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Day 14, 03-10-2023:</b><br>
					Started on adding interaction on the player in collaboration with another designer. Mostly spent the
					day talking to internship-people.

				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Day 15,04-10-2023:</b><br>
					Did some prototyping of the dialogue box which will bring some life to the world and the player's
					interaction with the loomies. It's mostly fluff but it did not take too long to implement so it's
					alright. Added a typewriter effect for the text so that it feels a little more alive talking to the
					loomies.
					<a href="images/LL_DialogueBox.mkv"></a>

				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Day 16, 05-10-2023:</b><br>
					Starting to set up UI. Not much else was done.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Day 17, 06-10-2023:</b><br>
					Started to rethink the UI, and as health does not add anything to the game we have decided to cut it
					completely. This only affects UI so far.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Day 18, 09-10-2023:</b><br>
					Added some feedback to the UI, it now pops and is very clear for the user.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Day 19, 10-10-2023:</b><br>
					Spent the day adding more feedback to the UI and changing some things for poor Albin. Now the glide
					has a max-timer and UI to boot which makes it <i>pretty nice</i>.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Day 26, 17-10-2023:</b><br>
					I am not gonna update every day anymore, got sick and tired of it. Sorry not sorry Fanny :)
				</p>
				<p>
					Since last update I have been working on a drop shadow for the avatar as to make it easier for the
					players to determine where they will land.
					Started working on a hook-point, which the player can use to traverse using the fishing rod, I have
					a feeling it will be scrapped as it really doesn't do much that the current player movement already
					don't do.</p>
				<p>
					We replaced the dreamcatchers with what internally is called "gay container", its a vial of rainbow
					liquid which contains childrens' hopes and dreams.
				</p>
				<p>
					There has also been work at implementing "KawaiiPhysics" to make the hair of the avatar swing and
					react to movement without animators needing to spend a lot of time doing so.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>02-3-11-2023:</b><br>
					Post-Beta Update.
				</p>
				<p>
					Since last time I have been hard at working making the start & options menu of the game. They are
					still having slight issues but they are mostly working as intended. Some issues I have encountered
					have been with timing and restricting animations to their expected timings and to not have them clip
					with each other. One way we optimized these animations was by making a custom animation macro
					instead of utilizing timelines which are very expensive.
				</p>
				<p>
					I have also been implementing the player abilities properly by stripping them off the base-player
					and then being able to give them with the help of pick-ups. This also includes fishin in ponds to
					get them which I also have been implementing the animations and logic for. It is missing the actual
					fish spawning as we wanted it to have a nice little floaty animation which I need to steal some math
					for.
				</p>
				<p>
					I have also been hard at work getting my pickups to work in multiplayer and matching the UI animations to both players. And other general small bugfixes and implementation of feedback such as "Hold Shift to Walk", less delay on VFX spawning & making some collisions simpler to improve performance.

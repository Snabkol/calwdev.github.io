              Thrift started of as a personal project during mine and my friend
              <a class="inline-hyperlink" href="https://lukasarnold.weebly.com/">Lukas Arnold's</a> time at
              Playgroundsquad. Both of us knew that we wanted to make something bigger than we could on our own; so we
              decided to collaborate. The goal was to create a small vertical gameplay slice taking inspiration from
              some of our favourite games: Dishonored, Thief, Outer Wilds & Sly Cooper.
            </p>

            <p class="project-details__desc-para">
              We ended up with a game where the player has a lot of freedom in their movement. They can vault over any
              ledge and are equipped with a gun capable of placing platform on any surface.
            </p>

            <h3 class="project-details__content-title">My Contribution</h3>
            <p class="project-details__desc-para">
              For the project I was doing most of the <strong>programming in Blueprints</strong> and focused my design
              on <strong>Gameplay & UI.</strong>
              Below you will find a handful of the systems I made for the game.
            </p>

            <p class="project-details__desc-para">
              <strong>Vaulting</strong><br>
            </p>

            <div class="responsive-container-2">
              <iframe class="responsive-iframe" src="https://blueprintue.com/render/s9xfc9ms/" scrolling="no"
                allowfullscreen="" width="100%" frameborder="0"></iframe>
            </div>

            <p class="project-details__desc-para">
              The system to vault over any ledge proved to be quite a hassle to set up and is split into three parts -
              <li class="project-details__desc-li">1. A forward check for walls</li>
              <li class="project-details__desc-li">2. An Upwards check to see if that wall has a ledge within "climb
                range"</li>
              <li class="project-details__desc-li">3. A "simulated" vault to see if the collider of the player character
                can fit at the projected end location of the vault</li>
            </p>

            <p class="project-details__desc-para">
              We still had some issues where the player would get stuck inside meshes, we figured out that the traces
              sometimes started inside the mesh and would not collide with anything at all. We solved the issue by
              making our geometry double-sided which made our performance take a hit, but with the game being so small
              it was not a big issue for us. Vaulting now works in pretty much all the places we tested without any
              major issues.
            </p>

            <div class="responsive-container-2">
              <iframe class="responsive-iframe" src="https://blueprintue.com/render/q_5ab-sn/" scrolling="no"
                allowfullscreen="" width="100%" frameborder="0"></iframe>
            </div>

            <p class="project-details__desc-para">
              This other graph for vaulting is the auto-crouch. I added it because we felt that the player would be
              limited in their movement if they could not vault where they would have to end up crouching at the end.
              This allowed for more open level design where you could vault into slips and smaller entrances.
            </p>

            <div class="responsive-container-2">
              <iframe class="responsive-iframe" src="https://blueprintue.com/render/bdrz_lnm/" scrolling="no"
                allowfullscreen="" width="100%" frameborder="0"></iframe>
            </div>

            <p class="project-details__desc-para">
              As for the actual vaulting itself I decided to “animate” the player with code. First giving them a slight
              backwards offset and then climbing up & forward. This gives the vaultinga smooth feeling while also
              seeming somewhat more realistic.
            </p>

            <p class="project-details__desc-para">
              This “animation” also has the added benefit of preventing the player
              avatar from clipping into the wall or the ledge so it becomes a nice double win!
            </p>

            <p class="project-details__desc-para">
              <strong>User Interface</strong><br>
            </p>

            <div class="project-details__showcase-img-cont">
              <img src="./assets/Games/Thrift/UI.webp" alt="UI" class="project-details__showcase-img" />
            </div>

            <p class="project-details__desc-para">
              The UI was a fun one for me. I wished to make a <strong>simplistic and minimalistic</strong> UI with the
              most important
              element shown clearly and without disruption. This ended up as the final design.
            </p>

            <p class="project-details__desc-para">
              It is quite right-side-heavy but I find that it gets all the necessary information across without
              cluttering the screen. The circular bars in the middle represent lockpicking progress and stamina
              respectively.
            </p>

            <p class="project-details__desc-para">
              These fade out when they are not currently in use (ie. empty for lockpicking & full for stamina) The only
              persistent elements of the UI are the money counter, ammo counter & collected keys which should all be
              visible to convey what resources the player is currently carrying so that they may plan their route
              accordingly.
            </p>

            <p class="project-details__desc-para">
              Slightly Above (to the left) of the ammo counter is the crouch status-icon. This icon appears when the
              player is crouching to signal the character’s sneaky and slow behaviour.
            </p>

            </div>

            <p class="project-details__desc-para">
              Another aspect was the <strong>Interact Prompts</strong>. I decided to make these into worldspace widgets
              that keep to the
              style with thick black borders. In the event of doors that require a certain key, we have made sure to
              <strong>color code</strong> the word with the color of the lock & the key. This is all automated and set
              up via the door
              making it easy to configure each instance. Every interactable in the game has a prompt and a key to
              trigger the interaction.
            </p>

            <p class="project-details__desc-para">
              One thing that has always been frustrating in stealth games is the lack of information which makes it hard
              to plan your sneaky ventures ahead of time.
            </p>

            <p class="project-details__desc-para">
              I wanted to solve this issue by introducing <strong>footstep prompts</strong>. Together with actual sounds
              being emitted,
              if the player is in a reasonable range from the footsteps they will also be able to see them to give
              further information regarding positions of guards.
            </p>

            <p class="project-details__desc-para">
              However, to not make the player rely solely on this mechanic we added some stationary guards around the
              map as well that will catch an unsuspecting player off guard if they abuse the footstep prompts.
            </p>

              <strong>Easy to use actors for level design</strong>

            <p class="project-details__desc-para">
              Learning to utilise the <strong>construction script</strong> was a fun experience. I wanted to make as
              many of my
              map-actors changeable and <strong>instance editable</strong> to make it easier for Lukas to place them
              where he saw fit and
              customise without too much hassle. This ended up being quite an interesting thing to develop and I will
              definitely keep making construction scripts for myself and others in the future!
            </p>

            <p class="project-details__desc-para">
              During Thrift I interconnected the gameplay and cosmetic logic of these actors. Later I learned about
              inheritance and has preferred that workflow over what I did here, even if I still use the construction
              script to run cosmetic changes to this day!

              Other than elements of the project listed above I also fiddled with making some art in the form of a
              material that sticks to surfaces as well as two post-processing materials to make the game get a stylized
              look via thick outlines & a cel shader.

            <p class="project-details__desc-para">
              The Cel shader was made following a tutorial by UnrealCG and altering it slightly to more align to our

              Similarly, the outline Post-Process Material was made following a tutorial by Ben Cloward. Mostly altering

              The displacement or “sticky” material was inspired by a post by Unsweet on Artstation. This material was
              used for the platforms that the projectiles produce to give it a really sticky look.
